Enterprise Software License Agreement
This license agreement ("the Agreement") governs the terms and conditions 
under which the Easy_Type software ("the Software") is licensed 
by Enterprise Modules BV of the Netherlands, Chamber of Commerce TBD 
("Enterprise Modules") to NAME_LICENSEE, LICENSEE DETAILS ("Licensee").
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any rights or obligations of Licensee (or 
others) with respect to the community edition of the Software.
Article 1.	Grant of license
1.1	Enterprise Modules hereby grants to Licensee the right to use the 
Software for its internal business purposes. This right includes the right 
to copy, install and use an unlimited number of copies of the Software on 
an unlimited number of computers within the organization of Licensee.
1.2	The license granted in the previous paragraph is limited to managing the 
number of nodes for which Licensee has paid the applicable fee and 
whose node names have been registered with Enterprise Modules 
("Entitled Nodes"). 
1.3	Entitled Nodes may be added at any time. An Entitled Node can be 
cancelled by the end of a twelve-month period from the date the Entitled 
Node was added ("the Entitled Node Term"). Unless an Entitled Node is 
cancelled at least one month prior to the end of the Entitled Node Term, 
the Entitled Node Term shall be extended with additional twelve-month 
terms each time.
1.4	The license includes the right to modify the Software as desired by 
Licensee. However, Enterprise Modules is under no obligation to provide 
any support regarding aspects of the Software modified by Licensee.
Article 2.	License limitations
2.1	All right, title and interest to the Software, the accompanying 
documentation and all modifications and extensions thereto rest and 
remain with Enterprise Modules. Licensee only has the rights and 
permissions explicitly granted by this agreement or granted in writing 
otherwise. Licensee shall not use, copy, distribute or publish the software 
in any other manner.
2.2	In particular, Licensee shall not:
a)	provide copies of the Software to third parties, including to entities 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Licensee;
b)	sublicense the Software or otherwise make available the Software to 
such third parties, including by rental, Software-as-a-Service models or 
otherwise;
c)	remove indications of Enterprise Modules as copyright holder of the 
Software or to remove or render illegible any part thereof.
2.3	The Software comprises third-party open source software. The 
respective third-party rights holders grant Licensee the rights indicated 
in the applicable open source licenses. These licenses can be found in the 
documentation. The Agreement does not apply to this open source 
software, and nothing in this agreement shall be construed as a 
limitation of any right granted under an open source license.
2.4	Licensee shall only provide access to the source code of the Software to 
employees of Licensee and independent contractors performing work for 
Licensee if such access is necessary for the use of the Software and only if 
such employees and contractors have agreed in writing to be bound by 
terms that are at least as protective of Enterprise Modules's rights as the 
Agreement.
Article 3.	Delivery of software
3.1	Enterprise Modules shall make available for download to Licensee a 
master copy of the Software.
3.2	Enterprise Modules shall make available on its website for Licensee an 
electronic collection of support documents ("Documentation").
3.3	From time to time Enterprise Modules may make available updates to 
the Software and/or Documentation. Enterprise Modules will use its best 
efforts to notify Licensee about such availability. Licensee is itself 
responsible for downloading and installing these updates. 
Article 4.	Support
4.1	For the duration of the Agreement Enterprise Modules will provide 
Licensee with a reasonable level of second-level support regarding use of 
the Software. Licensee is itself responsible for first-level support towards 
end users.

Support Manager shall be the sole point of contact with Enterprise 
Modules for support issues.
4.3	Support is available between 09:00-17:00 CET on working days, that is 
the days excluding Saturday and Sunday and Dutch national holidays.
4.4	Enterprise Modules may refuse to provide support for issues addressed 
in updates not installed by Licensee, or charge a surcharge for any extra 
work in such situations.
4.5	Upon request the parties can discuss the contents, pricing and other 
terms of more specific support terms to be provided in a separate Service 
Level Agreement (SLA). If and when such an SLA is concluded, its 
provisions will prevail over any conflicting provisions in this document.
Article 5.	Representations and warranties
5.1	Enterprise Modules represents and warrants the following:
?	That it is a company in good standing with the authority to grant the 
rights hereunder;
?	That the Software operates substantially as described in the 
Documentation;

implied, including without limitation any implied warranties of 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement 
of third party rights regarding the Software.
5.3	Licensee acknowledges that it is solely responsible for compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation all

and any other country in which Licensee does business.
Article 6.	Indemnification
6.1	Enterprise Modules shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensee 
against any liability arising from any claim by any third party against 
Licensee that the Software infringes on its copyright or violates its 
license under such copyright ("a Claim") but only under the provisions of 
this article.
6.2	Licensee shall promptly notify Enterprise Modules in writing of any 
Claims it receives, and enable Enterprise Modules (at Enterprise 
Modules's expense) to control the defense or settlement of the Claim on 
behalf of Licensee, and provide Enterprise Modules immediately with all 
support which Enterprise Modules may reasonably require in the 
defense or settlement of the Claim. Both parties carry their own out-of-
pocket costs in connection with these activities.
6.3	To address the Claim, Enterprise Modules may, at its discretion,
a)	procure for Licensee the right to continue using the Software; or
b)	provide Licensee with a modification or update to the Software that 
avoids or settles the Claim; or
c)	if the above is not possible under reasonable terms and conditions after 
best negotiation and technical efforts by Enterprise Modules, terminate 
the Agreement.
6.4	Any costs or license fees associated with options a or b above shall be 
fully borne by Enterprise Modules.
6.5	Enterprise Modules shall reimburse Licensee in respect of any final 
award of damages by a court of competent jurisdiction holding that a 
Claim is valid, or in respect of any monies to be paid under a settlement 
agreement regarding a Claim, however only if the Claim is directly and 
solely attributable to the Software. 
6.6	No liability or obligation to indemnify shall exist for any modifications or 
changes to the Software made by Licensee or for Licensee by any third 
party without the prior written approval of Enterprise Modules or for 
any Claims that would have been resolved or avoided but for Licensee's 
refusal of a modification or update provided by Enterprise Modules.
6.7	Enterprise Modules's entire liability and obligation to reimburse under 
this article shall be subject to the limitation of article 9.
6.8	In all other aspects, Licensee shall release, defend, indemnify and hold 
harmless Enterprise Modules from and against any and all claims, 
damages and liability arising in connection with the Software, including 
from claims, damages or liability from customers of Licensee.
Article 7.	Confidentiality provisions
7.1	A party that receives information marked as confidential or under 
circumstances making it clear the information was intended to be 
confidential ("Confidential Information") from the other party shall 
protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information by a 
reasonable degree of care against unauthorized disclosure for the term of 
the Agreement and a period of three years thereafter. 
7.2	Each party warrants that any employees that have a need to know 
Confidential Information are bound to terms and conditions related to 
the use and disclosure of Confidential Information which are at least as 
stringent as provided in the Agreement.
7.3	Confidential Information may be disclosed in response to a valid court or 
other governmental order, provided (if permitted by such order) the 
disclosing party is notified as soon as possible after receipt of the order 
and given an opportunity to seek legal redress against such disclosure.
7.4	Information which would otherwise be Confidential Information shall 
not be deemed Confidential Information to the extent that the receiving 
party proves by written records that said information:
a)	is or has become publicly available without any wrongdoing by the 
receiving party;
b)	is known and on record at the receiving party prior to disclosure by the 
disclosing party;
c)	is lawfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party who is not 
bound by similar confidentiality obligations; or
d)	is developed by the receiving party completely independently of any 
such disclosure by the disclosing party.
7.5	.Upon first request of the disclosing party, the receiving party shall 
destroy or return to the disclosing party all Confidential Information 
received in written or other tangible form, including all copies thereof. 
7.6	The receiving party shall use its best efforts to assist the disclosing party 
in identifying and preventing any unauthorized use or disclosure of any 
Confidential Information. Without limitation of the foregoing, the 
receiving party shall advise the disclosing party immediately in the event 
the receiving party learns or has reason to believe that any person who 
has had access to Confidential Information has violated or intends to 
violate the terms of this Agreement. The receiving party will cooperate 
with the disclosing party in seeking injunctive or other equitable relief 
against any such person.
7.7	The parties acknowledge that disclosure or use of Confidential 
Information in violation of this Agreement could cause irreparable harm 
to the disclosing party for which monetary damages may be difficult to 
ascertain or an inadequate remedy. The parties therefore agree that the 
disclosing party will have the right, in addition to its other rights and 
remedies, to seek injunctive relief for any actual or threatened violation 
of this Agreement.
Article 8.	Limitation of liability
8.1	Enterprise Modules shall be liable to Licensee only for damages arising 
out of its intentional misconduct towards Licensee or materially 
negligent performance of any of its obligations under the Agreement.
8.2	Enterprise Modules shall not be liable for any consequential, special, 
punitive and/or incidental damages, including loss of profits or fines 
imposed by regulatory bodies, arising out of or in connection with the 
agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
8.3	Any liability of Enterprise Modules for an event shall be limited to the 
amount actually paid by Licensee to Enterprise Modules in the six 
months preceding the date the event occurred. 
8.4	No liability shall exist for damages that have not been reported to 
Enterprise Modules in writing within two weeks of their occurrence, or 
for damages where Licensee failed to take appropriate measures to limit 
such damages.
8.5	Neither party may bring an action, regardless of form, arising out of or 
related to the agreement more than one year after the cause of action has 
arisen or the date of discovery of such cause, whichever is later.

the date of termination of the agreement.
Article 9.	Force majeure
9.1	Enterprise Modules shall not be liable for any failure to fulfill any of its 
obligations under the agreement if that failure is due to force majeure.

epidemics, security bugs in operating system and middleware software 
parts of the Software, breakthroughs in cryptography and interruption in 
internet connectivity.
9.2	If the force majeure lasts for more than thirty consecutive days, either 
party is entitled to terminate the agreement with immediate effect. No 
obligation to reimburse any costs, fees or expenses shall exist for either 
party in case of such termination.
Article 10.	Export control
10.1	As the Software contains components implementing 
cryptography, Licensee hereby agrees to not export, or transfer for the 
purpose of re-export, any copies of the Software in violation of any 
European Union, U.S., international or other applicable regulation, treaty, 
resolution, Executive Order, law, statute or order. 
10.2	Further, Licensee shall not export and shall not permit the export 
of any such copies to any prohibited or embargoed country or to any

costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the collection of the 
debt, as provided in Dutch law.
Article 12.	Compliance and audits
12.1	The Software contains a module designed to limit operation to 
Entitled Nodes. This module validates the presence of digital certificates 
signed by Enterprise Modules for each Entitled Node. Licensee shall not 
disable or circumvent this module for any reason, nor shall Licensee 
acquire such certificates except from Enterprise Modules.
12.2	Once every calendar year Enterprise Modules may have an 
independent reputable third party auditor audit in confidence Licensee's 
deployment and use of the Software and Documentation for compliance 
with this Agreement. 
12.3	If Licensee's use of the Software or Documentation is found to be 
greater than contracted for, Licensee will be invoiced for the additional 
use from the time this additional use started or, if in Enterprise 
Modules's opinion, such time cannot be easily established, from the 
starting date of the Agreement. 
12.4	If the resulting adjustments are greater than five (5) percent 
compared to what has been paid by Licensee under this Agreement, 
Licensee will pay the costs associated with such audit in addition to the 
additional amount to be paid.
Article 13.	Duration and termination
13.1	The parties enter into this agreement on the date the Software is 
first made available to Licensee and remains in force until terminated.
13.2	In case a party blamefully fails to comply with the material 
obligations under the Agreement, the other party may terminate the 
Agreement at any time, but only after the party that failed to comply has 
not remedied the failure within a reasonable time period after having 
received a written notice of default that is adequate and as detailed as 
possible.
13.3	Either party may terminate this agreement by means of written 
notice to the other party with effect on the date the last Entitled Node 
Term expires. Licensee must provide one month's notice; Enterprise 
Modules must provide six month's notice.
?	A party may immediately terminate the agreement by written notice to 
the other party, without the requirement for notice of default or 
intervention of the Court, in the event of the following:  
?	if the other party has been granted suspension of payments, whether 
provisionally or not; 
?	if a petition for bankruptcy has been filed with respect to the other party 
and the petition has not been revoked within in seven days;
?	if the other party files for bankruptcy itself; or 
?	if the other party's enterprise is dissolved or terminated, except for the 
purpose of a merger with or absorption by another company.
Article 14.	Changes to the Agreement
14.1	Enterprise Modules has the right to adapt or add to the Agreement 
once every calendar year. Such adapted or additional terms shall be 
communicated at least six months prior their taking effect. 
14.2	If Licensee does not wish to accept an adapted or additional term, 
Licensee must raise its objection to Enterprise Modules within four 
months after being notified about these terms. Enterprise Modules then 
may, at its discretion, withdraw the adaptation or addition. If Enterprise 
Modules does not do so, Licensee has the right to terminate the 
agreement at the end of the six-month period. Failure to terminate so 
constitutes acceptance of such terms.
Article 15.	Choice of law and venue
15.1	The law of the Netherlands governs the agreement and these 
terms and conditions.
15.2	Any disputes arising between Enterprise Modules and Licensee in 
connection with the agreement will be settled by the competent courts in 
the Netherlands for the principal place of business of Enterprise 
Modules.
15.3	The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.
Article 16.	Miscellaneous provisions
16.1	The Agreement shall not be assigned or otherwise transferred by 
Licensee without the prior written consent of Enterprise Modules, which 
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such assignment without such 
consent will be null and void. However, no consent of Licensee is 
necessary for an assignment or transfer of the Agreement to any 
company controlling, controlled by or under common control with 
Enterprise Modules or to any company that succeeds to substantially all 
of Enterprise Modules's business. This Agreement shall bind and inure to 
the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. 
16.2	The failure of either party at any time to require performance by 
the other party of any provision of the agreement shall in no way affect 
that party's right to enforce such provisions, nor shall the waiver by 
either party of any breach of any provision of the agreement be taken or 
held to be a waiver of any further breach of the same provision.
16.3	Any requirement for a "written" statement can be fulfilled by 
using a digitized version communicated by electronic means such as 
facsimile or e-mail, provided the identity of the sender and integrity of 
such electronic means can be determined with sufficient certainty. 
16.4	The section headings in this Agreement are for convenience only 
and shall not be used in construing or interpreting either.
16.5	The applicability of any general terms and conditions supplied by 
Licensee is explicitly rejected. Any terms, conditions or exceptions that 
deviate from this Agreement are binding upon Enterprise Modules only if 
explicitly confirmed in writing by an authorized officer of Enterprise 
Modules.
16.6	In the event that any part of the agreement or these terms and 
conditions become or are declared to be invalid by any court of 
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the rest of this 
agreement. The parties shall in such a case determine one or more 
replacement provisions that most closely approximate the clause 
concerned and which is legal under applicable law.
